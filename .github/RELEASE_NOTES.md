**Beta, for testing only.** Expect crashes and missing features.

You need your own Super Smash Bros. Melee disc image. **No game data ships in
these artifacts** — the port reads everything, including its font atlases, from
the image you supply at runtime.

**USA revision 2 (NTSC-U 1.02, GALE01)** is the supported disc. A Europe (PAL,
GALP01) image boots experimentally, running the USA game code on PAL data with
English (UK) text.

     of truth for what works; nothing here may contradict it). -->

## Highlights

- **Online matches no longer fail with "match handshake failed" when the host
  has Items set to Off.** The game stores Items: Off as 255, and the rules
  check only allowed 0-5, so the other player silently discarded the host's
  rules and both sides sat through a 15 s timeout. Any player with Items Off
  saved in their VS settings failed about half their online matches this way.
  Found in real two-machine testing by @Joyastick (#91).
- **Matchmaking starts faster.** A player who was already paired kept greeting
  newly found players, who then locked onto them and waited 8 s before
  searching again. A paired player now stays quiet.

## Fixes

- **LAN peers on a non-release build could not see each other**: the build
  version did not fit its 32-byte announce field and the whole announcement
  was dropped (#92, @Joyastick).
- **LAN on Windows could pick a VPN adapter** (Tailscale, Radmin, ZeroTier)
  instead of the real network card, because adapter names were matched
  case-sensitively (#93, @Joyastick).

## Known issues

Open reports are tracked on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/999sian/melee-pc/issues);
the numbers below link there.

**All platforms**

- Online play is a prototype. LAN Play, Direct Connect, Unranked and Ranked are
  implemented and rendezvous through the public DHT, but pairing across two
  NATs and live ranked acceptance are unproven, and cross-platform simulation
  determinism is not claimed. Ratings are community-computed and unverified.
  Every datagram is authenticated (protocol 8, since v0.2), and the LAN lobby
  only pairs identical builds, so both players should update to v0.2.1. A
  connect code is 8 characters after the `#`.
- Widescreen applies to fights (VS, Sudden Death, Training); menus, results and
  cutscenes stay at the original aspect. The wide HUD is a separate toggle and
  only moves the timer and the 2-4 player HUD groups.
- A move, stage or effect whose shader is still compiling is missing from the
  picture for a few frames (previously a freeze, #46). The bundled seed is
  queued for compilation on worker threads when the game starts, and the
  launcher waits for that queue when you press Play -- press Play again to skip
  the wait. `MELEE_PIPELINE_SYNC=1` restores the old wait-for-compile
  behaviour, and `MELEE_PIPELINE_JOBS=<n>` sets the compile thread count.
  On Android, Qualcomm Adreno GPUs still compile shaders inline, because the
  Adreno 750 driver fails when pipelines are created on a second thread, so
  expect some first-use stutter there.
- Only Vulkan, Direct3D 12/11 and Metal backends are shipped; OpenGL and
  OpenGL ES-only GPUs and drivers do not run the game (#64, #66).
- Gamepad buttons, sticks and triggers can be remapped; dash sensitivity,
  tap-jump disable and input buffer settings are not available (#3).
- Some users cannot get past the launcher; if the launcher shows but the game
  never starts, run with the log enabled and attach it (#40).

**Browser**

- Tested in Chrome only; Firefox and Safari WebGPU support is incomplete.
- Only a raw, uncompressed USA revision 2 (GALE01) image loads: no `.ciso`,
  `.rvz` or PAL.
- No online play, and no gamepad remapping (the default mapping is used; the
  keys are listed under the canvas).

**Windows**

- v0.1.6-beta and later can close immediately when starting the game from the
  launcher on machines where v0.1.5-beta worked (#62, #63). Attach
  `melee-pc.log` (or run `RUN-AND-LOG.bat`).
- Intel Gen7 iGPUs (HD 4000/4400/4600, Ivy Bridge/Haswell, e.g. i5-4200U) are
  refused by D3D12, and the Direct3D 11 path they are meant to fall back to has
  not been verified on that hardware. A `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG` mid-match
  there (#67) is the 2020-era Intel driver timing out on the GPU; there is no
  further API to fall back to on it. The log names the adapter, backend and
  driver version.

**Android**

- Some devices close the app at launch before the launcher appears, reported
  on an Honor 200 (Snapdragon 7 Gen 3) and an AYN Odin 2 (#59, #23).
- Android 9 and devices without Vulkan are not supported (#66).

**macOS**

- The macOS builds are experimental; the Intel one is untested on hardware.
  The game's C is compiled with Homebrew GCC (`scalar_storage_order`), the
  C++ with Apple clang.

## Config / save compatibility

- `launcher.cfg` (key/value text in the `melee-pc` preference directory:
  `~/.local/share/melee-pc`, `%APPDATA%\melee-pc`, or
  `~/Library/Application Support/melee-pc`) loads across versions: unknown
  keys are ignored and missing keys take their defaults.
- Memory cards are Dolphin-compatible `.gci` files and are unchanged by this
  release.
- Gamepad bindings live in aurora's per-device `.controller` files next to
  `launcher.cfg`.
- The pipeline cache (`pipeline_cache.db` in the same directory) is rebuilt as
  needed; deleting it only costs first-use shader stutter.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (x86-64 or ARM64): Direct3D 12 feature level 11_0 or Vulkan
  1.1; a Direct3D 11 fallback exists but is unverified.
  Linux (x86-64 or aarch64): Vulkan 1.1. macOS: Metal (Apple Silicon tested).
  Android: arm64 with Vulkan 1.1. iOS 14+: arm64, Metal. Browser: Chrome or
  Edge with WebGPU.
- Keep `resources/` (and on Windows the DLLs) beside the executable.
- A Melee USA 1.02 (GALE01) disc image (`.iso`, `.gcm`, `.ciso` or `.rvz`).

## Previous releases

### Changes in v0.2.1-beta

#### Highlights

- **Play in your browser.** https://999sian.github.io/melee-pc/play/ runs the
  same game and renderer as the native builds, at 60 fps, in Chrome or Edge
  with WebGPU. Your own disc image is read in the page and never uploaded. The
  platform was contributed by @turtlesoupy (#85). The first visit reloads the
  page once to enable the threads the engine needs.
- **Rollback netplay recovers from hitches instead of stalling.** A side whose
  game froze now catches up in whole frames: after a 250 ms freeze the two
  sides are back within one frame instead of drifting for seconds, and the
  stalls per freeze fell from about 3.5 to about 1.1. Packets are received,
  acknowledged and timed on their own thread, so a freeze on one side no
  longer shows up as a ping spike on both (339 ms -> 27 ms in the test). The
  fight input delay never drops below 2 frames, which cut the waits on a
  ~60 ms link from 7,996 to 1,365 per fight.
- **Android: shaders no longer compile in the middle of a frame.** On most
  GPUs they are built on a background thread, and only pipelines this device
  has already built are warmed at startup. On a Pixel 8 Pro the PC's waits on
  the phone in a LAN match went from 300-480 to 1. The game asks for a 60 Hz
  display, supports Android's game modes, and no longer restarts when the font
  size changes.
- **Lighter on weak machines.** The frame and disc-wait loops sleep instead of
  spinning (a core at 94 % after a hitch now sits at 8 %), the per-frame
  texture sweep went from 1.8 ms to 0.1 ms on a slow core, and the reverb only
  runs while something feeds it. That alone took the audio thread from 7.9 %
  to 0.6 % of a slow core. Settings gain a reverb toggle and a one-press
  **Performance** preset (native resolution, no MSAA or anisotropic filtering,
  reverb off).

#### Fixes

- **Audio and video froze every ~2 s with an Xbox controller on the Xbox
  Wireless Adapter (#90).** While no GameCube adapter was plugged in, the game
  re-scanned every HID device once a second under the joystick lock, which
  takes ~800 ms per scan on Windows with that controller attached. It now looks
  again only when a USB/HID device is added or removed.
- **The launcher's shader wait never ended on Android.** Play waited for
  pipelines that no thread would ever build; it now waits only for work that
  is actually queued.
- **A disc read in progress dropped a whole netplay session into lockstep**,
  logged as out of memory. A refused rollback snapshot now costs one lockstep
  frame.
- **LAN lobby**: a match is refused when the two peers are on different
  screens (a desync at frame 141), peers are kept across a lobby restart, a
  failed lobby can be retried, and the host sends the rules as soon as it opens
  the session.
- **ARM builds (Android, iOS, Windows ARM64, Linux aarch64) treated `char` as
  unsigned**, unlike the original game; the new-unlock notice drew its random
  number 6 frames early there. Everything is now compiled with signed `char`.
- **Rendering on PowerVR and Adreno**: the shader bit-extract form is kept off
  PowerVR only, since the Adreno 750 driver cannot link the shift form.

### Changes in v0.2-beta

#### Highlights

- **Online play is authenticated end to end.** Every datagram now carries a
  keyed MAC over its header and body (protocol 8), so someone who can reach
  your address can no longer inject inputs, acknowledgements, delay changes or
  a disconnect into a session. The same review closed a forged `RULES` that
  could lock out the real host, made LAN auto-join require a peer that has
  actually been seen in the lobby, stopped DHT matchmaking from dialling
  private, broadcast and multicast addresses, and pinned ranked history to its
  genesis rating.
- **Connect codes are longer, and everyone's code has changed.** The suffix
  after the `#` is now 8 characters instead of 4, carrying 40 bits of your key.
  Read the new one off the Online Profile screen and send that. Peers must be
  on the same build: a v0.2 client and a v0.1.10 client cannot play each other.
- **Shader stutter is largely gone on a fresh install.** The bundled pipeline
  cache had not been found since v0.1.8 (#79), so every packaged build was
  compiling every shader from scratch; and the launcher now spends that
  compilation queue while you are already waiting there instead of during your
  first matches.

#### Fixes

- **Windows: online matches could never start (#87).** The peer address was
  rebuilt through a `struct in_addr` whose first member is a byte array on
  Windows, so only the first octet survived: a peer at 74.244.47.247 was dialled
  as 74.0.0.0, the game sat on frame 0 and the session died on the connect
  timeout. It was reported as a crash because the window stopped redrawing.
- **The bundled shader cache was never loaded (#79).** v0.1.8 pointed the
  resource path at `resources/` for the launcher's own assets, which also moved
  the lookup for `initial_pipeline_cache.db` -- and every packaging script still
  writes it beside the executable. Since v0.1.8 the 11,905-config seed was found
  on no platform, which is what "the shaders take a long time to load" was.
- **Marth's Dancing Blade and Roy's Double-Edge Dance did not glow (#86).** The
  colour-animation duration was declared as `bool`, so every value above 1
  became 1 and the overlay was removed on the next frame. A live match asks for
  13 frames.
- **The F1 menu went on acting on input after it was closed (#84).** Hiding it
  leaves RmlUi's focus inside the hidden page, so Return still reached the
  widgets and applied them -- the select sound playing over live gameplay.
- **Android: the launcher could not be used, and hiding the touch controls was
  permanent (#88, #75).** The touch overlay is the only touch entry point and
  its analog-stick zone covers the lower-left quarter of the screen, so it
  swallowed the taps meant for "Choose disc"; it is now inert while the launcher
  is up. "Hide Touch Controls" also hid the settings pill that owns the toggle,
  so the hide could not be undone; it is a toggle now and the pill stays.
- **Netplay no longer hangs or wedges.** The scene hand-off had no deadline; a
  peer could freeze the game for ever by advancing one frame just under the
  no-progress bound; and a direct session could run unagreed, each side playing
  on its own boot seed. A desync is now reported rather than silently absorbed.
- **Three memory-safety defects in the netplay layer**, found by review: a
  `snprintf` length accumulated past its buffer on the desync path, a SHA-1
  length over-reading a stack buffer, and an unchecked `XXH3_createState`.
- **Rollback corrections and pacing**: latency stability, per-scene delay,
  phase-sync on frame advantage, and a recording that replays without
  diverging.
- **A session id can only be established by a `RULES` packet**, so a forged
  16-byte `RelAck` can no longer end a session permanently, and `REL_DELAY` is
  no longer accepted from the guest with an unbound frame field.

### Changes in v0.1.10.1-beta

#### Highlights

A point release for two bugs reported against v0.1.10-beta, both hit on a
first online visit.

#### Fixes

- **Online Profile said "Identity unavailable. Check your profile files"**, and
  Direct Connect then hosted an empty code, so nobody could be dialed. An
  `identity.key` whose length was not 32 bytes (a 0-byte file left by a crash
  or a full disk between the create and the write, or a truncated copy) was
  refused forever: every later run failed the same way until the file was
  deleted by hand. A file that cannot hold a key is now replaced, and every
  failure logs the path and errno. A readable 32-byte key is never touched.
  If yours was damaged, your connect code changes: the old key was
  unrecoverable either way.
- **The launcher's Discord icon never loaded** (`Failed to open file
  '<game dir>\discord.png'`). Relative assets in the launcher page were looked
  up beside the executable instead of in `resources/`.

### Changes in v0.1.10-beta

#### Highlights

- **Internet play over the DHT (prototype):** signed Direct, Unranked and
  Ranked best-of-three matchmaking, rendezvous through the public Mainline DHT
  with no server of ours in the path, plus burst hole punching for cellular
  and double-NAT links. Public DHT storage is verified; two-NAT pairing and
  live ranked acceptance are still pending.
- **Direct Connect asks for the code in game:** the lobby prompts for your
  friend's connect code instead of silently reusing whatever the launcher
  field last held. Stick or D-pad left/right picks a slot, up/down cycles the
  character, START connects, and a blank code hosts your own code for a friend
  to dial. Previously two players who both opened Direct Connect each hosted
  their own code and never met.
- **Rollback snapshots on every supported platform**, so Windows and macOS no
  longer fall back to lockstep from the first frame.

#### Fixes

- Ask for the connect code before starting a Direct Connect session, and keep
  the "not a connect code" message on screen until the code is edited.
- Retry after a failed direct session re-opens code entry instead of dropping
  the code and restarting as public matchmaking. Untested: forcing a direct
  session to fail needs a second peer, so this path is reviewed but not
  exercised by a run.
- Handle a graceful peer disconnect and stop the lobby from exhausting memory
  while it waits.
- Restore unranked and LAN stage picking, and fix the LAN lobby menu exit.
- Stop the idle attract loop from running under the online lobby, suppress SFX
  overflow spam, and disconnect cleanly when the window closes.
- Announce immediately on the DHT and improve bootstrapping so a search finds
  peers without waiting for the next announce window.
- Repair the Windows (MinGW `uint32_t`, winsock `accept` clash) and macOS
  x86_64 (symbol-less object in the snapshot sectioner) builds, and point the
  python netplay fixtures at the configured build directory in CI.

### Changes in v0.1.9-beta

#### Highlights

This maintenance release improved controller input, LAN session startup and
safe update selection, and included the fixes merged since v0.1.8-beta.

#### Fixes

- Correct GameCube-range analog scaling and full-strength button-to-stick bindings.
- Publish GameCube adapter input safely between the polling and game threads,
  including disconnects and rumble commands.
- Keep held adapter and touch buttons suppressed when closing the settings
  overlay until those controls are released.
- Prevent the updater from freezing when a release has no compatible asset.
- Preserve rollback corrections when snapshot allocation fails, and use lockstep
  from the start on platforms without snapshot support.
- Keep LAN peers at the agreed start frame while waiting for readiness.
- Restore Windows builds by using SDL for environment-file settings.
- Include the recent Polar Bear Adventure Mode crash fix, Linux GameCube
  adapter detection improvements, and bundled controller database.
- Include the upstream scene timing, asynchronous disc transfer and deterministic
  replay fixes. Netplay remains a prototype; this release does not claim universal
  cross-platform determinism.

### Changes in v0.1.8-beta

#### Highlights

- **Rollback Netplay & LAN Play Prototype (#72):**
  - Native in-game Online menu (`VS Mode > ONLINE`) featuring LAN Play and Direct IP connect, complete with an interactive *Mario Kart: Double Dash*-style LAN lobby counter.
  - Native rollback netplay engine with state snapshotting, deterministic simulation rollbacks, reliable UDP messaging, and live in-game network HUD showing ping, delay, and rollback frame count.
  - Cross-platform floating-point determinism (`-ffp-contract=off`, unified musl trigonometry) guaranteeing simulation parity across Linux, Windows, and Android.
- **Native macOS Support (Apple Silicon & Intel) (#65):**
  - Native macOS `.app` bundle packages (`Melee-macOS-arm64.zip` and `Melee-macOS-x86_64.zip`) using the Apple Metal graphics backend via WebGPU/Dawn.
  - Built with Homebrew GCC big-endian scalar storage order translation and automatic dylib staging.
- **Experimental PAL Disc Support (#65):**
  - Boot European / PAL disc images (GALP01) using USA game code with automatic string index remapping, PAL kerning tables, and single-byte SIS font decoding.
- **Hitlag, SDI and DI are fixed:** Every build before this one gave *every*
  hit in the game exactly 3 frames of hitlag regardless of damage, instead of
  4-20. Hits had almost no freeze, SDI was effectively impossible (one input at
  best, usually none), and because DI is established from the stick at the
  moment hitlag ends, the DI window was 3 frames too, so launches landed at
  their raw undirected endpoint. That reads in play as "no hitlag, no SDI, and
  everybody gets sent way further than usual" — thanks to Syrox for the report
  that identified it. Hitlag is now `floor(floor(floor(d/3 + 3) * e) * c)`
  capped at 20, with the 1.5x electric multiplier on the victim and the
  0.666667x crouch-cancel multiplier, verified against 1634 measured hits.
  Knockback *magnitude* was never affected: 259 measured launches match the
  vanilla formula exactly.
- **Direct3D 11 backend (Windows):** a Direct3D 11 path is now built and ordered after D3D12, ahead of Vulkan, for the GPUs Dawn refuses on D3D12 (Intel Gen7 / Haswell-era iGPUs); it is also selectable in the launcher's *Graphics backend* setting and as `MELEE_BACKEND=d3d11`. **Untested on real Windows hardware**: the adapter enumerates and the fall-back to D3D12 works, but nobody has yet seen a D3D11 device created. Reports with a log are wanted. The log records each skipped backend and why, plus the adapter and driver chosen.
- **Universal Controller Fix (UCF 0.8x):** dashback and shield-drop rules, off by default; toggle on the launcher's Gameplay page or the F1 port menu ("Universal Controller Fix"), or force with `MELEE_UCF=1`.

#### Fixes

- **Adventure Mode Topi / ReDead Crash Fix (fixes #68, #71):** Resolved an LP64 64-bit struct alignment bug in `itZako_ItemVars` that caused Topi's icicle back-reference to be overwritten, crashing the game with `SIGSEGV` when attacking or KO'ing enemies on Icicle Mountain and Underground Maze.
- **Android Handshake Compatibility:** Gated `getrandom()` behind API 28+ check with `/dev/urandom` fallback for older Android releases (API 26/27).
- **First-use shader pipeline compiles no longer freeze the game (#46):** a draw whose pipeline is still compiling is skipped for a few frames, compiles run on a low-priority worker pool (`MELEE_PIPELINE_JOBS`), and the bundled seed is queued at the session's MSAA level. `MELEE_PIPELINE_SYNC=1` restores the old blocking behaviour.


### Changes in v0.1.7-beta

- **Native Windows ARM64 Support:**
  - Added pure native ARM64 PE executable (`Melee-Windows-arm64.zip`) compiled with `llvm-mingw` and GCC-powered big-endian scalar storage order translation.
  - Bundles native ARM64 WebGPU/Dawn (`dxcompiler.dll`, `dxil.dll`, `webgpu_dawn.dll`), Nod (`nod.dll`), and app-local Visual C++ ARM64 runtime DLLs.
  - Tested on Windows 11 on ARM devices including Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3, and Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ PCs.

- **Native iOS Support (arm64):**
  - Added native iOS app bundle and sideloadable package (`Melee-iOS-arm64.ipa`) targeting iOS 14.0+ arm64.
  - Metal graphics backend powered by WebGPU/Dawn with seamless resolution scaling and retina display support.
  - Touch input through fixed screen regions (stick on the left half, face buttons bottom right). There is no drawn overlay, no calibration and no controller auto-hide on iOS; that overlay is Android-only.
  - RmlUi settings launcher with auto-detection of game images in the app sandbox and Apple `os_log` system logging.

- **Memory Safety & Fighter Stability Fixes:**
  - **Falco & Fox Illusion Afterimage Crash Fix:** Fixed memory corruption and access violations in `ftafterimage.c` and `itfoxillusion.c` during Event 23 and fast multi-afterimage rendering.
  - **64-bit Disc Pointer Reconstruction (DP macro):** Reconstructed 64-bit host pointers across fighter, item, stage, and particle systems, ensuring safe referencing on 64-bit architectures.
  - **Windows/MinGW DECL_WEAK Symbol Resolution (fixes #61):** Resolved weak symbol linking behavior in MinGW to prevent null function pointer dereferencing on `OSReport` calls.
  - **Audio Thread Concurrency & Mutex Safety:** Resolved audio thread startup race condition and mutex re-entrancy in `audio.c`.

- **UI & Layout Synchronizations:**
  - Synchronized Cheats menu layout and resources between pre-game launcher and in-game F1 settings overlay.

### Changes in v0.1.6-beta

- **Linux aarch64 (ARM64) Support:**
  - Added native Linux ARM64 AppImage (`Melee-aarch64.AppImage`) and portable tarball (`melee-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`) builds via GitHub Actions on Ubuntu ARM runners.
  - Integrated Nod prebuilts for aarch64 Linux and configured automated cross-compilation pipeline.
  - Tested and verified on 64-bit ARM Linux platforms including Raspberry Pi 5, Asahi Linux on Apple Silicon, Orange Pi, Rockchip RK3588, and Linux ARM handhelds.

- **Phase 1 Feature Pack & Cheats Restructuring:**
  - **Custom Soundtrack Streaming:** Embedded `stb_vorbis` audio stream decoder supporting runtime `.ogg` and `.wav` file overrides for BGM. Automatically loads stage soundtrack replacements placed in `music/` or loose folders and blends them with in-game music volume controls.
  - **Free / Unlocked Pause Camera:** Added a Free Camera cheat toggle in settings and in-game F1 overlay, permitting full 360-degree pitch/yaw rotation and 0.5f–5000.0f zoom distance while paused.
  - **Wide HUD Anchoring (16:9):** Match timer, stock icons, damage percentages, and player tags are dynamically anchored outwards for native 16:9 widescreen viewports (toggleable between Classic 4:3 and Wide 16:9 in Graphics settings).
  - **Dedicated Cheats Tab:** Restructured launcher and in-game F1 menu with a dedicated "Cheats" tab housing *Unlock All*, *Frozen Stadium* (hazardless Pokémon Stadium), and *Free Camera*.

- **Multi-Core & Responsiveness Architecture:**
  - **1000 Hz Input Polling Thread:** Decoupled controller polling (`HSD_PadRead`) from the 60 Hz game loop into a dedicated 1000 Hz OS worker thread (`src/pc/input_poll.c`), minimizing input latency and polling jitter across all controllers.
  - **SIMD AX Voice Mixer:** Vectorized voice processing and mixing loops using ARM NEON and x86 AVX, significantly reducing CPU usage during heavy multi-player sound effect spam.
  - **Decoupled Audio Pipeline & Concurrency:** Removed global `OSDisableInterrupts()` lock from `render_frame()`, restricting interrupt disables strictly to the 5 ms synth tick, and protected voice parameter updates under a dedicated recursive `s_audio_mutex`.
  - **4-Core & Handheld / Switch Scheduling Fixes (fixes #47):** Removed restrictive 2-core thread pinning on Nintendo Switch (Tegra X1) and 4-core Linux/ARM SBCs, elevating FIFO and render worker thread priorities so all cores are utilized evenly without core thrashing.

- **In-Memory Persistent Asset Cache & Fast Loading:**
  - **In-Memory Persistent Asset Cache (`file_cache.cpp`):** Pristine raw disc archives (`.dat`, `.usd`) are cached in host RAM on first read, providing instant 0 ms loads on recurring character, stage, and menu transitions.
  - **Background Asset Pre-Warming:** Background worker preloads Tier 1 tournament files (core fighter files, tournament stages, common UI) on boot without hitching gameplay.
  - **Adaptive Low-End RAM Budgeting & LRU Eviction:** Dynamic cache budgeting (`PROFILE_LOW_RAM` <= 2GB, `PROFILE_HANDHELD` 2-4GB, `PROFILE_DESKTOP` > 4GB) with LRU eviction and I/O throttling for low-memory systems (Raspberry Pi 4, low-RAM SBCs).
  - **Loose Directory VFS Overlays:** Seamlessly load replacement game files from local loose folders (`MELEE_FILES_DIR`, `./files/`) without rebuilding ISOs.
  - **Snappy Transitions:** Fast fade delay clamping (optional `MELEE_FAST_FADES`).

- **Android & Mobile Optimizations:**
  - **Android 60 FPS First-Play Intro Optimization:** Eliminated main-thread pipeline compilation stalls during `MvOpen.mth` by stopping unrequested background shader queue drainage when `!g_hasPipelineThread`.
  - **Faster Android Boot Times:** Instant check in `seed_pipeline_cache()` skips SQLite re-seeding if already populated, cutting 1.5–3.0s off warm launches.
  - **Adreno GPU Color Correction (fixes #20):** Prefer RGBA8Unorm swapchain format to fix inverted red/blue colors on Qualcomm Adreno GPUs.

- **Memory Management & OS Startup Stability:**
  - **Early MEM1 Pre-Allocation (fixes #43):** Pre-allocates GameCube MEM1 at process startup via `OSInit()` before SDL and GPU drivers fragment low 32-bit virtual memory.
  - **Windows VirtualAlloc2 64KB Alignment (fixes #43):** Fixed 64KB alignment (`0xFFFF0000`) and added VirtualQuery scanning fallback to guarantee MEM1 sits strictly under 4GB on Windows 10/11.
  - **ARAM Address Translation in File Cache (fixes #50):** Fixed fatal access violations in Adventure Mode and character loading by translating ARAM addresses (`< 0x01000000`) via `aurora_aram_base()`.

### Changes in v0.1.5-beta

- **Android Performance & Frame Pacing Overhaul (Full 60 FPS):**
  - **Eliminated GX FIFO futex wake storm:** Slashed kernel context-switching overhead by over 95% by increasing `kDrawBatchSize` from 1 to 16 and gating thread wakeups on active waiter state (`sWorkerWaiting` / `sMainThreadWaitingForProcessed`), completely removing the 155% sys CPU time lockup on mobile GPUs.
  - **Unpinned CPU threads for mobile schedulers (EAS):** Disabled strict core cache domain affinity on Android so the Linux kernel Energy Aware Scheduler (EAS) can dynamically migrate audio, video, and render threads across prime and performance cores without triggering Qualcomm CPU frequency throttling down to 600 MHz.
  - **Locked 60.0 Hz display refresh mode:** Configured Android window attributes to explicitly request a 60 Hz display refresh rate, eliminating frame cadence judder and swapchain pacing mismatches on 120 Hz and 144 Hz mobile displays.
  - **Native Android logging:** Integrated Aurora engine diagnostics directly into Android logcat (`__android_log_print` under tag `Aurora`).

- **On-Screen Touch Controls & Controller Auto-Detection (Android):**
  - **Complete GameCube touch layout:** Added an ergonomic, responsive on-screen overlay featuring the analog Control Stick, C-Stick, A, B, X, Y, Z, L, R, D-Pad, and Start buttons.
  - **Quick Settings modal:** Added a dedicated overlay gear button to dynamically toggle touch controls, invert C-Stick Y axis, toggle haptic vibration, adjust stick deadzones, and calibrate overlay opacity.
  - **Automatic physical controller detection:** Touch controls automatically hide when a physical Bluetooth or USB gamepad is connected and actively used, and seamlessly reappear as soon as the touchscreen is tapped.
  - **Persistent settings:** Touch settings and calibration are saved to `launcher.cfg` across app launches.

- **Zero-Copy Disc Streaming & Loading Speed:**
  - Implemented zero-copy memory-mapped (`mmap`) streaming in Aurora's DVD reader for uncompressed raw ISO images.
  - Enlarged DevCom I/O buffers and optimized background disc streaming threads, drastically cutting synchronous read hitches and audio desyncs during match transitions and movies.

- **Fighter, Stage & Engine Fixes:**
  - Synced with upstream Melee decomp (`662250b9`).
  - Fixed #18: Corrected Melee display aspect ratio (73:60) and 16:9 widescreen projection scaling.
  - Fixed #19: Fixed Mute City particle generator leak and subsequent FPS drop.
  - Fixed #27: Fixed Classic mode Mario trophy reward crash caused by incorrect return type in `gm_1736`.
  - Fixed #29: Corrected Giga Bowser KO bonus endian bitfield layout.
  - Fixed #12, #30, #38: Corrected collision bitmask types in item ground collision (`itgroundcoll`).
  - Fixed #39: Corrected Corneria Star Fox dialogue cutscene argument types.
  - Fixed #32: Clamped Wobbuffet damage underflow when frozen.
  - Fixed #25, #35: Added null-safety checks in `grzakogenerator` and `itoldottosea`.
  - Fixed #16: Corrected Bowser fire breath animation loop condition.
  - Fixed #31: Fixed Yoshi egg breakout particle effect scalar storage order.
  - Fixed disc pointer camera/light animations and memory free safety in trophy scene.

### Changes in v0.1.4-beta

- **Fighter & Gameplay Fixes:**
  - Fixed #16: Fixed Bowser's Neutral Special (Fire Breath) getting stuck permanently. Frame counter `xC` in `ftKoopa_SpecialNVars` was previously declared as `bool`, preventing the timer from reaching the 40-frame threshold required to detect B-button release and transition into `SpecialNEnd`.
  - Fixed #15: Fixed Bunny Hood attachment rendering on fighter heads by loading ear offset vectors through `DISC_VEC3_GET` in `ftCommon_8007FA00`, restoring big-endian float byte-swapping.
  - Fixed #14: Fixed Giant Melee sound effects playing at high pitch instead of low pitch by correcting `Player_GetMoreFlagsBit6` return type from `bool` to `u8`, preserving the Giant flag without truncating it to Tiny.
  - Fixed #12: Fixed reflector and shield item behavior by correcting `ReflectDesc.x20_behavior` to `s32`.
  - Fixed #11: Fixed item capsule drop crash caused by `ItCapsuleAttr.x0` being typed as `bool` instead of `s32`.
  - Fixed #10: Fixed Tournament Mode crash caused by big-endian `u16` table access in `lbl_803D9F80`.
  - Corrected big-endian disc layouts for `itOldottoseaAttributes`, `ScopeBeamAttrs`, `itToolsMotionAttrs`, `GroundParam`, `itWhiteBeaAttributes`, and `ftKb_DatAttrs`.
  - Fixed command stream endian decoding in `grMaterial_801C9490`.

- **Platform & System Stability:**
  - Fixed #9: Fixed Android MEM1 mapping crash (`Failed to map MEM1 at 0x80000000`) on Android 11+ by scanning candidate ranges strictly below 4GB when the default base address is occupied.
  - Fixed #13: Fixed Android crash shortly after launch by disabling pre-warmed background Vulkan pipeline worker threads that conflicted with Qualcomm Adreno drivers during asset loading.
  - Fixed 64-bit pointer truncation in `OSRoundUp32B` and `OSRoundDown32B` using `uintptr_t`.
  - Fixed 64-bit pointer safety across `HSD_SisLib_803A84BC`, screenshot saves, Sheik chain joint creation, Green Greens blocks, and fighter accessory cleanup.
  - Clamped audio pitch ratio to 4.0f to eliminate `cvttss2si` signed integer overflow undefined behavior on x86-64.
  - Fixed JPEG Huffman AC code byte-swapping in snapshot saving (`hsd_3B34.c`, `hsd_3B5C.c`) and added `DISC_STRUCT` to snapshot save headers.
  - Fixed Event Mode text color RGBA channel ordering on little-endian platforms.

### Changes in v0.1.3-beta

- **Performance & Stuttering:**
  - Deconflicted hardware VSync and software frame pacing in `vi.c`. Manual `SDL_DelayPrecise` sleep now only runs when VSync is disabled, preventing monitor refresh rate drift from tripping sudden 30 FPS drops under strict FIFO VSync.
  - Bundled the pre-recorded pipeline cache seed (`initial_pipeline_cache.db`) into the Linux AppImage, Linux portable tarball, and Android APK assets (previously only shipped on Windows), eliminating first-run shader compilation pop-in and stutter across all platforms.
  - Added user-facing Graphics Backend selection (Direct3D 12 vs. Vulkan vs. Auto) in the Launcher settings, in-game F1 overlay, and `launcher.cfg`.
  - Scaled disc preloader threads dynamically up to 4 concurrent threads in Aurora's DVD reader, parallelizing block decompression for compressed `.ciso` and `.rvz` disc images to reduce synchronous asset load hitches.
  - Added CMake support for Link-Time Optimization (`MELEE_ENABLE_LTO`).
- **Game & Platform Fixes:**
  - Fixed #5: Prevented memory corruption and crash when backing out of Tournament mode by properly typing archive handles.
  - Fixed #4: Set stage clear flag on 100-man melee completion so Falco challenger approach is triggered.
  - Fixed #8: Fixed infinite sparkle loop on Final Destination.
  - Fixed #7: Scanned user space under 4GB for MEM1 allocation on Windows, and auto-detected ISOs in `RUN-AND-LOG.bat`.
  - Added GameCube ISO file selection support on Android.
  - Statically linked `libstdc++` and `libgcc` on Windows and removed mismatched compiler runtime DLLs.

### Changes in v0.1.2-beta

- Fixed disc pointers being used without resolution in the HSD object
  loaders. `HSD_IDGetData` is keyed on the resolved host pointer, but jobj,
  pobj and robj looked up with the raw 32-bit disc slot, so those lookups
  always missed and left child joints and envelope references null.
- Rewrote the AObj animation callback dispatch. It previously guessed at
  four signatures, reading a float out of parameters that hold an integer
  or a pointer and dropping arguments entirely in other cases; it now
  dispatches on the real calling convention.
- Kept MEM1 below 4GB on Windows. The allocator fell back to letting the OS
  place it anywhere, which on 64-bit Windows means above 4GB, and every
  32-bit disc pointer slot into it then truncates.
- `MELEE_BACKEND` pins the graphics backend (`vulkan`, `d3d12`, `null`, ...)
  and the log now records which one a run selected. Thanks to
  @alexscott2718-gif.
- The log is timestamped, records a marker for any frame over 50ms, and
  survives a crash: output is flushed per line, Windows writes
  `melee-pc.log` beside the exe, and a fault logs a backtrace naming the
  module it came from.
- The Windows zip ships a pipeline cache seed, so shaders are not all
  compiled the first time each one is used.

### Changes in v0.1.1-beta

- Fixed a crash in the attract demo. Kirby's and Jigglypuff's multi-jump
  attributes are read straight off the disc, but were decoded in the wrong
  byte order, so the second jump looked up motion state `0x55010000` instead
  of `341` and faulted.
- Fixed the remaining places where a pointer was stashed in a 32-bit field
  and truncated on 64-bit builds: the HSD id table and object heap, the
  sislib text cursor stack, the THP video decoder, and pointer slots in the
  Hyrule Castle, Brinstar, Big Blue and Fountain of Dreams stage state.
- Fixed the Windows build failing to start on a real Windows PC. The zip did
  not ship the Visual C++ runtime that Dawn, dxcompiler, SDL3 and nod import,
  so Windows refused to load it with "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found". Wine
  and Proton supply that runtime themselves, which is why it only broke on
  actual Windows. Those DLLs now ship in the zip, and packaging fails if any
  import is left unresolved.
- The Android APK is now a signed release build rather than a debug build,
  and is named `Melee-Android-arm64.apk`.
- Fixed the Android CI build, which depended on a toolchain path that only
  existed on one machine.

## What works

Every game mode runs. The per-feature list, including what is only partly
done, is the status table in
[README.md](https://github.com/999sian/melee-pc#status); it is the single
source of truth and these notes defer to it.

## Controls

Arrows or WASD = stick, IJKL = C-stick, X = A, Z = B, C = X, V = Y, Q/E = L/R,
Tab = Z, Enter = Start, TFGH = D-pad. Gamepads work through SDL and can be
remapped; an official GameCube adapter is read directly. **F1** opens the
settings overlay.
