/* Netplay prototype: two instances exchange one PADStatus per frame over UDP
 * and run in rollback lockstep modelled on Slippi (docs/netcode-plan.md §4):
 * a remote input that has not arrived yet is predicted as "repeat last", a
 * snapshot is taken before every predicted tick, and when the real input
 * turns out different the state is restored and the frames since re-run.
 * Both peers must boot with the same disc and no memory card; every session
 * agrees the rest -- seed, rules and unlock state -- in the match handshake,
 * the env path below included (net_handshake.c's handshake_direct). Sessions
 * can also be opened at runtime through pc_net_connect() (src/pc/net_lan.h).
 *
 *   MELEE_NET=host:port          peer address (enables netplay at boot)
 *   MELEE_NET_PORT=n             local UDP port (default 41000)
 *   MELEE_NET_PLAYER=0|1         which controller port the local player drives
 *   MELEE_NET_DELAY=n|auto       input delay in frames (default auto: from ping and jitter)
 *   MELEE_NET_RECONNECT_MS=ms    resume an interrupted session for this long (default 3000, 0 off)
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_LOSS=percent   drop that share of outgoing packets
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_DELAY_MS=ms    hold every outgoing packet that long
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_DELAY_RX_MS=ms hold every incoming packet that long (asymmetric links)
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_JITTER_MS=ms   uniform +-ms on the outgoing delay (reorders when > delay)
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_REORDER=pct    hold that share of packets behind the next one
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_DUP=pct        send that share of packets twice
 *   MELEE_NET_SIM_BURST=n        every 5 s drop n consecutive outgoing packets
 *   (the simulator's PRNG is seeded from MELEE_NET_PORT, so runs repeat)
 *
 * This file is the session, the socket and the rollback loop; the wire
 * codec, link simulator, reliable channel, handshake, time sync and
 * snapshots are the net_*.c modules listed in net_internal.h. */

 * finished: the game thread is merely parked in wait_remote(), every byte
 * of game state is intact and both input rings still hold their last RING
 * frames. The stall timeout now opens a reconnect phase instead. The
 * socket, the 4 ms transmit timer and the 16 ms resends of the wait loop
 * stay exactly as they are, so the peer keeps being probed; on top of that
 * each side that opens a phase states what it holds in exactly one reliable
 * REL_RESUME (a statement, never answered: see net_resume_rel). Both sides
 * refill the gap through the ordinary input path (send_inputs' unacked
 * window, widened to REDUNDANCY while the phase is open) and the wait ends
 * at the frame it was waiting for, the frames that were predicted before
 * the interruption being rolled back as usual.
 *
 * The rings bound what can be resumed and both sides' rings are frozen
 * during the phase: whoever is not parked can only run WINDOW + delay
 * frames past the other before it parks too, so one check at exchange time
 * cannot go stale.
 *
 * None of this runs in the common case and the frame loop grows no branch
 * for it: the phase is entered from the stall path, the refill rides on the
 * redundancy floor send_inputs already loads, and a refused exchange is
 * noticed by the very next wait (which is at most WINDOW frames away, since
 * a parked peer stops producing input).
 *
 * MELEE_NET_RECONNECT_MS bounds the phase. The default is RECONNECT_MS: a
 * Wi-Fi roam or a hotspot handover completes well inside it, and the whole
 * outage (STALL_TIMEOUT_MS to notice plus this window) stays near 6 s, which
 * is about as long as a player waits before quitting anyway. Both were 7 s
 * and 15 s until faf888914 shortened them, trading a longer outage tolerance
 * for much faster "the peer is gone" detection; 0 disables resume, i.e. the

 *

 *
 * 1. The wall clock. gmtitle.c:161-170 stirred the RNG once per

 *    the source, because no repair here can invent the draws the other peer
 *    made.
 *
 * 2. Scene timing. The rest are scene-enter draws -- stage init, CPU AI init
 *    inside Fighter_Create -- backtraced across three 9900-frame sessions
 *    and never paced by rendering. Two peers of similar speed make them on
 *    the same frame, but a slow device does not: an SM-T505 against this PC
 *    drew at frame 232 where the PC drew later, and desynced there. The seed
 *    a tick starts from must therefore be the seed the last tick ended with,
 *    whatever the gap between them contained.
 *
 * Netplay only (`net.active`). A recording leg must NOT do this: whether a
 * draw falls inside or outside a tick depends on load timing, so rewriting
 * the seed makes a recording that only replays on a machine of the same
 * speed -- measured, it moved the replay divergence to frame 1. Netplay is
 * the opposite case: both peers run one frame stream and the repair is
 * applied identically on each, which is what makes them agree. */

 * re-run them from the same input rings. Nothing about the inputs changed,
 * so every byte of the state must come back as it was; a block that does
 * not is the re-simulation diverging from the fresh pass on its own, which
 * is a desync waiting for a peer that re-ran a different set of frames.
 *
 * Each audit re-runs the range twice and reports two comparisons: the first
 * re-run against the first pass, and the second re-run against the first
 * re-run. The pair separates the two faults that both look like "the
 * re-simulation diverged": a tick that is not a pure function of (state,
 * inputs) breaks both, while a first pass that did something a re-run never
 * does -- rendered, loaded, ran a frame twice, read a clock -- breaks only
 * the first. Off unless the variable is set. */
