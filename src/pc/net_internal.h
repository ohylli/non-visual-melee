 *                   stall/barrier, rollback and the per-tick entry points
 *   net_wire.c      byte order, wire codecs, headers, pad conversion, and
 *                   the session key and per-datagram MAC
 *   net_sim.c       link simulator (loss/delay/jitter/reorder/dup/burst);
 *                   every outgoing datagram goes through tx()
 *   net_reliable.c  stop-and-wait reliable channel ('R'/'K')
 *   net_handshake.c RULES/READY match handshake and the rules in force
 *   net_sync.c      time sync (offset/jitter rings, skip/advance, auto delay)
 *   net_snapshot.c  snapshots, frame checksum, state ring, sync test,
 *                   record/replay
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 * Everything runs on the game thread except two helpers in net.c:
 *   - tx_timer, a 4 ms SDL timer that resends the newest input packet,
 *     releases held (simulated) datagrams and retransmits the reliable
 *     message in flight;
 *   - rx_main, the receive thread: it drains the socket, runs the
 *     authentication gate, acks each input packet and times each ack the
 *     moment it lands, and queues everything else for recv_inputs, which
 *     applies it on the game thread. Its gate state, counters and queue are
 *     under s_rx_lock (net.c), taken before tx_lock and never inside it.
 * The two helpers and the game thread share, under net.tx_lock only:
 *   - the socket: net.active flips under the lock too, so the timer never
 *     sends on a closed socket, and pc_net_disconnect removes the timer and
 *     joins the receive thread before taking the lock, so neither outlives
 *     the socket;
 *   - the frozen packet copy (s_last_pkt, net.c), the held queue (s_held,
 *     net_sim.c) and the sim knobs tx() reads, net.tx_pkts/tx_inputs;
 *   - the reliable transmit queue (s_rel_tx, net_reliable.c):
 *     s_rel_tx[s_rel_tx_head] is the message in flight, resent until its
 *     'K' arrives. The reliable receive queue is game thread only;
 *   - the session key (net_wire.c), the RTT ring, and net.session and
 *     net.peer, which the receive thread alone changes once a session is up
 *     (the guest learning its id, a dual-stack peer answering from another
 *     address).
 * All simulation state (frames, input rings, snapshots, rollback, time
 * sync, handshake, record/replay) is game thread only; pc_net_note_io
 * ignores other threads for that reason.
 *
 * Invariants
 * ----------
 *   - s_remote_have (net.c) is the newest contiguous real remote frame:
 *     every frame <= it holds real input in s_remote_ring, every simulated
 *     frame above it holds the prediction it ran on. A gap is never stored;
 *     the ack tells the peer what to resend.
 *   - a snapshot is valid only for its exact frame in the scene it was
 *     taken in: Snapshot.frame is -1 when it holds nothing usable and
 *     snapshot_unusable() must pass before a restore.
 *   - nothing at or below net.rb_barrier is rolled back to and no snapshot
 *     is taken for such a frame; the barrier only rises within a session.
 *   - net.frame is the next fresh frame; net.tick_frame is the frame of the
 *     tick being run (frame - 1 outside a rollback, older during one).
 *   - a datagram is authenticated before anything reads it: once one tag
 *     has verified, the receive gate accepts nothing that does not, so no state
 *     below it (peer address, session id, rings, reliable lane) can be
 *     moved by a datagram that is not the peer's.
 *   - net.tx_pkts/tx_inputs are counted under tx_lock and cleared by the
 *     game thread's report without it (a lost increment is a stat, not
 *     state). */
