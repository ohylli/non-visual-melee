"""Milestone M0 (docs/netcode-plan.md section 5 and 12): one recorded run must
replay bit-identical on every platform we ship.

    tools/net_determinism.py [--frames 2400] [--seed 7] [--exe build/melee]
                             [--win-exe build-win/melee.exe] [--disc ../melee.ciso]
                             [--work /tmp/net_determinism] [--port 42400]
                             [--only linux,linux-flip,windows] [--keep] [--state-log]

One reference recording is made on this Linux build with a fixed MELEE_SEED, a
fixed frame count and input driven through MELEE_KEY_FIFO (MELEE_DEBUG_VS=cpu,
so Link is keyboard-driven and Mario is a level-4 CPU: a real match, not an
idle one). That single file is then fed back with MELEE_NET_REPLAY to every
platform we can reach here, and src/pc/net_snapshot.c reports the first frame
whose checksum differs ("net: REPLAY DIVERGED at frame N").

Rows:
  linux-record  the reference build replaying the RECORDING leg's file. This
              row is about the recording, not about a platform: the recording
              leg runs with the 1 kHz keyboard poller live (MELEE_KEY_FIFO)
              and is paced differently from a replay, and the simulation is
              sensitive to that pacing, so this row currently diverges at the
              first frame of an input transition. Its own recording - written
              while being fed the recorded pads - is the canonical file every
              row below is judged against, so one defect cannot masquerade as
              the other.
  linux       the reference build replaying the canonical file; must be
              identical.
  linux-flip  the same recording with ONE byte flipped at a known frame; must
              report divergence at exactly that frame. Without this row a green
              table proves nothing - a replay harness that silently compares
              nothing looks identical on every platform.
  windows     build-win/melee.exe (tools/package_windows.sh) under Proton
              (tools/run_proton.sh).
  android     the APK from dist/ on a device over adb (not in the default
              --only: it installs and launches on whatever is attached).
              SKIPPED only when nothing is attached; with a device present
              every way it can fail - no env file, an unreadable disc, a
              crash - is a BLOCKED row naming the logcat line that said so.
  macos       SKIPPED here, no macOS host; the invocation it would use is
              printed so the row can be filled on real hardware.

Exit 0 when every platform that actually ran was identical (and the flip row
was caught), 1 otherwise. A platform that never reached the replay is reported
BLOCKED, never "identical" and never "diverged".

--state-log points MELEE_NET_STATE_LOG at <work>/<leg>.state, so every leg
writes "net: state f<N> ..." plus "net: bits f<N> ..." for each frame
(src/pc/net_snapshot.c). That is how a divergence is localised from "the
checksums differ at frame N" to "this field of this fighter differs": run it,
then diff two legs' .state files (or the recording leg's against a replay's)
over the frames around N. The bits line carries the raw float bits of exactly
the fields frame_checksum() folds, because the readable line rounds to three
decimals and hides a 1-ULP difference. Off by default.
